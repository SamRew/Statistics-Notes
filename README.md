# Statistics-Notes

  Use P(Y) or Pr(Y) to denote the probability of an event Y
  Probabilities are between 0 and 1
    P(Y)=0, event never happens
    P(Y)=1, event always happens
  Sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1 Y+notY=1
  Probabilities are related to odds
    odds in favor of event R are defined as O=P(R)/P(notR)=P(R)/(1-P(R))
    if P(R)=.2, then odds against are .8/.2=4 (4 to 1)
    if P(R)=.8, then odds against are .2/.8=.25 (1 to 4)
  Consider two events Y and Z
    If Y and Z can't happen together then we use a simple addition formula P(YorZ)=P(Y)+P(Z)
    These two events are independent of each other
    P(RH+ or A blood)=P(RH+) + P(A) - P(RH+ and A)
  An event Z may change the likelihood of event Y occuring
    We use P(Y|Z) for the conditional probability that Y occurs given that we know Z has occurred
    P(Y|Z)=P(Y and Z)/P(Z)
  Bayes' Rule 
   P(S|R)=(P(R and S)/P(R)=((PR|S)P(S))/P(R)
  Sensitivity=Probability that test is correctly positive
  Specificity=Probability that test is correctly negative
